        <p>My name is Abigail Russ, and I am currently a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I am working towards a dual degree in broadcast journalism at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism and economics at the School of Behavioral and Social Science. I am also a member of the Public Leadership Scholars program, which is a selective living and learning program offered by UMD. Outside of classes I am a campus tour guide and the treasurer of Alpha Phi Omega, a national service fraternity.</p>

        <p>I am dedicated and excited to build a career in both journalism and economics, and look forward to learning and growing as a young professional.</p>
