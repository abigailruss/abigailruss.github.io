        <p>
            My name is Abigail Russ and I am a junior at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am currently perusing a dual degree in journalism, from the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, and economics, from the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences.

        <p>
            During my first two years, completed my certificate in the Public Leadership track of College Park Scholars. The experience taught me how to write policy memos and create, advertise and award grants through the university's Do Good Institute.

            As a fourth generation Maryland Terrapin, I am actively involved in the College Park community. I am a member of Alpha Phi Omega, a service fraternity, where I serve on the Executive Board as the treasurer; Maryland Images, where I give tours to prospective students and their families and The Diamondback, where I am a reporter covering the University Senate.

            When I'm not working or giving tours, I can be found cheering for the Terps at football and basketball games, cooking, swimming, traveling or watching the Pittsburgh Steelers.
